# Gym Management Website

This project is a Gym Management Website that allows gym managers to efficiently handle user registrations, store transaction records, integrate with a payment gateway, and manage a supplement store. The website is built using a combination of PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Captcha for authentication.


## Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

PHP: A server-side scripting language used for handling backend logic and database operations.
MySQL: A relational database management system used for storing and managing user and transaction data.
HTML: The markup language used for structuring the website's content.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets used for designing and styling the website's layout and appearance.
JavaScript: A programming language used for implementing interactive and dynamic features on the website.
Google Captcha: A security feature that prevents automated bots from accessing the website and ensures user authentication.
RazorPay's Payment Gateway: Integration with RazorPay's payment gateway enables secure and convenient payment processing for users.



## Features

User Management: The website allows gym managers to add new users to the system, capturing relevant details such as personal information, membership type, and contact information.

Transaction Records: All transactions made within the gym, such as membership fees, supplement purchases, and other services, are recorded and stored securely in the database for future reference.

RazorPay Integration: The website seamlessly integrates with RazorPay's payment gateway, allowing users to make secure online payments for membership fees or any other charges.

Google Captcha: To ensure the security and authenticity of users, Google Captcha is implemented to verify that users are humans and not automated bots.
